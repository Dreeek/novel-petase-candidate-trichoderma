## 🚀 Next Steps - Push to GitHub

Since you've already created the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
cd C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\enzem\novel-petase-candidate-trichoderma

# Connect to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/novel-petase-candidate-trichoderma.git

# Push everything to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

## 📝 Note: Hydrophobicity Graph

I searched for the "Blue Hydrophobicity Graph" you mentioned but couldn't locate it in the enzem folder. 

**Options:**
1. If you have it elsewhere, copy it to `images/hydrophobicity_plot.png`
2. If you need to regenerate it, you'll need the Python script that created it
3. You can add it later and commit with: `git add images/hydrophobicity_plot.png && git commit -m "Add hydrophobicity analysis plot"`

Once added, update the README.md to include it:
```markdown
### A. The Hydrophobic Groove
![Hydrophobicity Profile](images/hydrophobicity_plot.png)
```

## ✨ What's Included

- ✅ Complete scientific README in academic English
- ✅ All AlphaFold2 structure files (5 models)  
- ✅ AlphaFold confidence plots (pLDDT showing lid domain flexibility)
- ✅ PAE plot showing domain structure
- ✅ MSA coverage plot
- ✅ Proper .gitignore
- ✅ Initial Git commit ready

Everything is organized professionally and ready for peer review!
